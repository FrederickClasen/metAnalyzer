# metAnalyzer
A growing collection of R scripts to analyse metabolomics abundance data. 

1. 1.Functions: Load packages and functions from the Functions script


2. 2.Load: Load three data files
          1. rawDat: A matrix with unique metabolites as rows and unique sample IDs as columns (there should be no duplicates!)&nbsp;
          2. sampleAnnot: First column corresponding to sample IDs in rawDat. All the following columns can be experimental metadata&nbsp;
          3. metAnnot: First column corresponding to metabolite IDs in rawDat. All the following columns can be metabolite annotations and groupings&nbsp;
          
3. 3.Plots: Plot raw data in heatmaps and barplots
4. Statistics (soon!)
