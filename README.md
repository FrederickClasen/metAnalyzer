A growing collection of R scripts to analyse metabolomics abundance data. 

1. 1.Functions: Load packages and functions from the Functions script


2. 2.Load: Load three data files
          1. rawDat: A matrix with unique metabolites as rows and unique sample IDs as columns (there should be no duplicates!)
          2. sampleAnnot: First column corresponding to sample IDs in rawDat. All the following columns can be experimental metadata
          3. metAnnot: First column corresponding to metabolite IDs in rawDat. All the following columns can be metabolite annotations and groupings
          
4. 3.Plots: Plot raw data in heatmaps and barplots
5. Statistics
